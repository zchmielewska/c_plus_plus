/*
Write another version of the program from Exercise 7 so that, instead of finding the final
amount of your investment, you tell the program the final amount and it figures out how
many years it will take, at a fixed rate of interest compounded yearly, to reach this
amount. What sort of loop is appropriate for this problem? (Donâ€™t worry about fractional
years; use an integer value for the year.)
